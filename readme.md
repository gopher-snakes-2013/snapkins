#### Drawing
A basic outline from StackOverflow:
1.) Attach a mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup event listener to the canvas DOM

2.) on mousedown, get the mouse coordinates, and use the moveTo() method to position your drawing cursor and the beginPath() method to begin a new drawing path.

3.) on mousemove, continuously add a new point to the path with lineTo(), and color the last segment with stroke().

4.) on mouseup, set a flag to disable the drawing.
